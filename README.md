# soc-predict
In this project, I used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm to predict the battery charge level (SoC) based on voltage, current, and temperature data. The chart compares the actual values with the predicted values, which demonstrates the model's ability to identify battery consumption patterns. (The closeness of the lines indicates the model's accuracy in the test conditions)
